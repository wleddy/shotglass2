Why do I need an account?
    Many parts of the web site require that you be signed in to your account to do anything 
    interesting.

Please! Not another account!!
    We get it. You really don't want to keep track of another account login and password. 
    More of your personal info smeared all over the internet.
    
    We try to keep it to a minimum. In most cases you don't need a password or user name. Just 
    an email account. Oh, and we'd like your name too but you don't have to use your real name. 
    We never check.

Creating your account

To create a new account (or to log in later...) click the **Login** link in the menu then
